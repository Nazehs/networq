Description

Networq is described best as a personal profile with social networking functionality. Users can create rich content using Markdown and even HTML/JS/CSS. All content can be pinned to the user profile and all content will be distributed to contacts in the networq system.

## Contributing

* Create something awesome, make the code better, add some functionality,
  whatever (this is the hardest part).
* [Fork it](http://help.github.com/forking/)
* Create new branch to make your changes
* Commit all your changes to your branch
* Submit a [pull request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)

#### Some tips before making a pull request
- Make sure that you've pulled the latest commits into your fork.
- Create a branch for your edits - that way the project maintainer can safely pull your code and test it out.
- If it's your first P.R, it'll be easier if you begin with something small first instead of making huge changes in lots of files. It helps me understand what the P.R is about, and we could help you out with the rest of changes if needed. It'll also save you from spending lot of effort in doing something that might not be necessary.
- An important thing to remember is to have a P.R that fixes one issue at a time, and not make changes to lot of files in the same P.R. This way it's easier to test the changes out and have a relatively clean commit log.
