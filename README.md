_Some tips before making a pull request_

Make sure that you've pulled the latest commits into your fork.
Create a branch for your edits - that way the project maintainer can safely pull your code and test it out.
If it's your first P.R, it'll be easier if you begin with something small first instead of making huge changes in lots of files. It helps me understand what the P.R is about, and I could help you out with the rest of changes if needed. It'll also save you from spending lot of effort in doing something that might not be necessary.
An important thing to remember is to have a P.R that fixes one issue at a time, and not make changes to lot of files in the same P.R. This way it's easier to test the changes out and have a relatively clean commit log.
